I Find handlebars and ejs interesting to go with for further development journey.

specifically in this project I chose to work with handlebars the reasons are:
1. not require any formatting of HTML page.
2. The logic or the conditions which are javascript basically, should be in the javascript file not in the VIEWS.
3. Lean.
